# stillity

<span class="ipa">/ˈstɪlɪti/</span>

noun &mdash; *A condition in which all individually noticeable sounds and movements are absent, leaving a soft background texture of white noise that is almost indetectable but that creates a feeling of fullness and intense presence in the moment.*

Deliberately reminiscient of *tranquility*.

<hr>

When snow falls heavily on a windless winter night, someone who is willing to be quiet and motionless, and who is far away from traffic, can listen carefully and experience *stillity*. This is quite different from sterile or empty silence.

Stillness (quiet lack of motion) is a precondition for perceiving *stillity* ().
