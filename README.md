I'm fascinated by the power of words. Having good words &mdash; words that are clear, unencumbered with thinking errors or ideological baggage, and associated with insightful and kind mental models &mdash; will improve the power, nuance, and gentleness of my communication.

In many cases, I can find good words by simply learning what's already been defined as an ordinary word, an expression, an idiom, or a term. No sense reinventing the wheel. But sometimes, I see a gap or problem that's best fixed with a new word of my own. That's the purpose of this dictionary. It contains my [neologisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism).
