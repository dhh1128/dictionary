In the best and longest marriages, both spouses experience *cogrowth*, and each can truthfully say to the other, "I *cogrow* you." This means something more than "I am familiar with you" or "I recognize you" or "I know you well" or "I know everything about you". It means that the speaker perceives, acknowledges, appreciates, seeks to understand, and nourishes:

* the partner as [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy))
* the self
* the [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence), synnergistic relationship

Thus, happily married spouses actively make choices to grow *together*, where "together" has two separate and equally valued meanings:

* independent individuals on parallel trajectories of shared experience
* a converging whole viewed as not just the sum of its parts

*Cogrowth* is enabled by [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy) and by what Steven Covey called *[interdependence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90MwSb21Rac)* (and is thus incompatible with dependence, trivial independence, codependence, and disorders like [psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy) and [narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism)). However, *cogrowth* has richer semantics, because it implies an ongoing commitment to adapt, a deep understanding, and mutual reverence.

*Cogrowth* is not necessarily pairwise. A sports team, business staff, or a squad of soldiers can experience *cogrowth* that is *n*-wise.

In scriptural language, *cogrow* may help convey the intent of the English word "know" (translated from [Strong's G1097](https://biblehub.com/greek/1097.htm), γινώσκω, ginosoko, 'to know, especially through personal experience') in Jesus's statement, "I am the good shepherd, and *know* my sheep, and am *known* of mine." ([John 10:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/10.14?lang=eng#p13))

In this vein, consider Jesus's rebuke of insincere followers with the statement about Himself, "I never knew you" ([Matt 7:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.23?lang=eng#p22)) and "I know you not" ([Matt 25:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.12?lang=eng#p11)); the JST's inversions "Ye never knew me" and "Ye know me not"; and the Book of Mormon's formulations in [Mosiah 26:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26.27?lang=eng#p26) and [3 Ne 14:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p23#p23). Sincere and insincere followers both express surprise at the Lord's judgment in the parable of the sheep and the goats, but have very different histories of *cogrowth* ([Matt 25:31-46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.31-46?lang=eng#p30)). It is also interesting to consider how *cogrow* might replace "know" (translated from [Strong's H3045](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3045.htm), יָדַע, yada) in Ps 139:1-2: "O Lord, thou hast searched me, and *known* me. Thou *knowest* my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off." The biblical "know" as a sexual euphimism (again Strong's H3045) &mdash; "And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived" ([Gen 4:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/4.1?lang=eng)) also recovers some of the rich beauty and multilayered meaning of the original Hebrew, plus loses some gender asymmetry, when translated as *cogrow*.

*Cogrowth* implies reciprocity, to some extent. However, this is not strictly necessary to the definition, because parties may have unequal intentionality, awareness, or ability to adapt. Not all marriages are happy or characterized by equal flexibility by both partners. A dog may *cogrow* its owner, even if the owner is not very tender. God and man can *cogrow* one another, though man's adaptation through repentance is very different from God's other-reaching through atonement, forgiveness, and revelation.

The definition of *cogrowth* is rooted in how humans experience relationships. However, by analogy, you can *cogrow* a truth by exploring its manifestations, analyzing it from every angle, and adapting your mental model and your behavior to accept, appreciate, and align with it. The truth is not intentionally converging with you, but your are appreciating its otherness and not demanding that it conform to your own preferences or manner of being. Ironically, when you do this, the truth's manifestations grow, because it begins to characterize *you*, and new synnergy emerges. "And ye shall *know* [[Strong's G1097](https://biblehub.com/greek/1097.htm)] the truth, and the truth shall make you free." ([John 8:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.32?lang=eng#p31))

In [symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis), neither a parasite nor its host *cogrow* one another, because the relationship is adversarial. Commensalism might be analyzed as one-sided cogrowth. Mutualism is a better example, though. It might also be said that strands of DNA *cogrow* one another.
